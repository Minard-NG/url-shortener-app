# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge solution

There comes a time in every web developer's life when they will need to shorten a URL. The reason could be to hide tracking links, make a link fit into a Tweet, make a more memorable link, make a link smaller to put it in print, add branding to a link, run an A/B test, retarget a link for market research, or maybe swap out a link at a later time (link rotation).

Developers wishing to take advantage of URL shortening technology will want to seek out URL Shortener APIs. The solution here, provides a convenient interface that integrates nicely with a URL shortening API to provide these functionalities.

### What I learnt

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Work on more project involving apis and learn more about backend developemnt.


### Useful resources

- [ShrtCode API Docs](https://shrtco.de/docs/) - ShrtCode is a privacy friendly url shortener that provides a developer's api. This documentation was very useful in getting me up and running with the api.
- [How do I store an array in localStorage?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3357553/how-do-i-store-an-array-in-localstorage#:~:text=Use%20localStorage.,work%20with%20the%20sessionStorage%20object.) - Yay, got a little hazy in memory, had to use stackoverflow for this.
- [CSS Tools: Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - To ensure styles are consistent on all browsers and also, worry less about the user agent styles that browsers add to the web pages. I used Eric Meyer's standard CSS reset. It was very helpful.
- [Hex to CSS FIlter Generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) - This code is very useful in convert hex color values to css filter values.
- [Top URL Shortener APIs](https://www.programmableweb.com/news/10-top-url-shortener-apis/brief/2020/06/21) - Learnt a lot about ros and cons of different shortening apis from this article.
